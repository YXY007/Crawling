Meanwhile, the remains of seven more people were found, bringing the death toll to 63, he said. \", \"Sheriff\\u2019s spokeswoman Miranda Bowersox said the missing-persons list would likely fluctuate greatly. \", \"\\u201cThe overall number will go down, but in the short term we expect we will see new reports of people missing,\\u201d she said. \", \"Some of those still unaccounted for have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities that they are alive, either because they lack telephone service or are unaware anyone is looking for them. On the other hand, there may be some people who perished but whose relatives have yet to report them missing. Communication disruptions after the fire have added to the confusion. \", \"The disaster already ranks among the deadliest wildfires in the United States since the turn of the last century. \", \"Authorities attribute the death toll partly to the speed with which flames raced through the town with little advance warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees. \", \"Weather conditions have since turned more favorable to the firefighting effort, Nick Pimlott, a Cal Fire engineer, told KRCR-TV. He said winds had died down, allowing crews around Lake Oroville to the southeast of Paradise to extend and shore up containment lines around the blaze. \", \"Many on the missing-persons list are over the age of 65, in keeping with the town\\u2019s recent history as a haven for retirees. \", \"Family of retired U.S. Navy veteran David Marbury, 66, have not heard from him since the wildfire erupted. On Thursday, Marbury\\u2019s landlord confirmed to relatives that his Paradise duplex had burned down. His car was still in the garage. \", \"\\u201cI really hope he\\u2019s still alive and we\\u2019re going to be able to see him,\\u201d Marbury\\u2019s niece, Sadia Quint, 30, told Reuters by phone. \", \"Some said they were experiencing survivors\\u2019 guilt. \\u201cYou\\u2019re like, \\u2018Why am I here?\\u2019\\u201d Sam Walker, a pastor at the First Baptist Church of Paradise, told WBUR radio. \\u201c\\u2018Why is my family all here? Why are our churches still standing?\\u2019 I don\\u2019t know. My house is gone, like so many others.\\u201d \", \"More than 300 California National Guard troops have been deployed to the fire zone to help search for victims, and to fill logistical, medical and administrative roles. \", \"Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Angle said seven soldiers from his battalion lost their homes in the fire, including one woman who asked to help with the recovery effort because it was \\u201cbetter for her piece of mind to be part of it.\\u201d \", \"The Camp Fire coincided with a series of smaller blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which is linked to three fatalities and has destroyed at least 500 structures near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. It was 57 percent contained on Friday. \", \"Scientists have said the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the West are largely attributable to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change. \", \"U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet displaced residents. Critics say Trump, a Republican, has politicized the fires by blaming them, without supporting evidence, on forest mismanagement by California. Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, planned to join Trump on his tour. \", \"\\u201cNow is a time to pull together for the people of California,\\u201d Brown and Newsom said in a joint statement. \", \"Smoke from the Camp Fire has spread broadly. Public schools in Sacramento 90 miles (150 km) to the south, and as far away as San Francisco and Oakland, canceled classes for Friday because of poor air quality. \", \"Reporting by Terray Sylvester; additional reporting by Alex\\nDobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee,\\nJonathan Allen in New York; Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago\\nWriting by Nick Carey, Bill Trott and Steve Gorman; editing by\\nBernadette Baum, Steve Orlofsky and Grant McCool\"]", "author": "Terray Sylvester", "time": "November 16, 2018", "title": "CORRECTED-UPDATE 8-California presses search for fire victims, number of missing soars"}
